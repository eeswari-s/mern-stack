1.What is HTML?
                 HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure webpages.
It tells the browser how to display text, images, links, and other content on a website.

2.Role of HTML in web development:
                      HTML is the foundation of every website. It gives structure and meaning to the content on a webpage. Without HTML, browsers wouldn’t know how to display text, images, or links properly.
                      Structuring content:

Defines headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, tables, forms, etc.

Example: <h1> for main heading, <p> for paragraph.

Providing semantics:

Helps browsers and search engines understand the content.

Example: <article>, <nav>, <footer> describe the purpose of content.

Integrating with other technologies:

Works with CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity).

Example: HTML creates buttons, CSS styles them, JS makes them clickable.

Building web applications:

Modern web apps (like e-commerce or social media sites) start with HTML structure.


📓	HTML syntax (tags, attributes, elements)
1. HTML Tag:
                Tags are the building blocks of HTML.
             Usually, they come in opening and closing form.
             Example:
                     <p>This is a paragraph.</p> 

 2. HTML Element:
             An element includes the opening tag, content, and closing tag together.
           Example:
         <p>Hello World!</p>      

3. HTML Attribute:
            Attributes provide additional information about an element.
            Placed inside the opening tag.
            Example:
            <a href="https://www.webpage.com">webpage</a>                       

4.HTML Heading Tags
            ⭐Headings are used to define the titles and subtitles on a webpage.
            ⭐HTML has 6 levels of headings: <h1> to <h6>.
              <h1> -is the largest and most important,
             <h6> is the smallest and least important.
